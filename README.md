## Project Overview

Design, Build and Test a working FM/AM radio from the component level. I would like to be able to control volume, switch between FM and AM radio, as well be able to tune my radio into multiple channels. I want to explore how to take a project from component level to a finished and polished design. I would consider my project a success if I can create a working radio with all specifications above that fits neatly into a 3D printed shell.   

## Educational Value Added

This project would teach me the fundamentals of how radio waves interact with circuits. This would allow me to broaden my understanding of radio wave signals as well as learn about the inner workings of a radio at the component level. My circuit design and analyzation skills would greatly improve. I would also learn how to design, create and assemple a case/enclosure for a final product. This project would help teach me how to apporach a large design oriented project and ultimatley produce a polished final product.
